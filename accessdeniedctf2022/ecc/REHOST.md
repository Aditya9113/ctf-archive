# REHOSTING

Link to files: [AccessDeniedCTF 2022](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/tree/main/ctfs/AccessDenied/2022/crypto/ECC)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge does not have linked files or dependencies. The only file that exists is the `chal.py`. The other file we have is the `output.txt`.

## Instaalling Tinyec
This challenge requires `tinyhec` which can be installed using this command:
```
pip install tinyec
```

This command works assuming you already have pip installed.
